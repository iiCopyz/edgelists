# edgelists -- Homework Assignemnt:

For this machine problem you should write code to input a weighted
graph edge by edge along with the weight of each edge. The graph should
be maintained as an edge list as discussed in the online lecture notes. Your
program should prompt you for the name of a file that contains the data
that defines the graph. Next your program will prompt you for the starting
vertex and the destination index. These would be input from the command
line.
To complete the program, add code to implement the algorithm discussed
in the online lecture notes to find the shortest path through the graph. The
program should print out the shortest path (you may choose to print the
path out in “reverse order”). Your code should be well organized and well
documented. If no such path exists your program should print out that no
such path exists.
The program that you write must be written by filling in the missing code.
No changes to the existing code is allowed. You should not declare any new
variables. You should not use an adjacency matrix and you should not use a
priority queue. Your program should closely follow the algorithm discussed
in the online lecture notes a copy of which is included in this assignment for
your convenience.
In addition, your program should be written by filling in the missing
parts, where indicated, of the following program. No changes to the given
code are allowed.
